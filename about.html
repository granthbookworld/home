                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Granth – The Book World started as a small neighbourhood shop,
                        created with one simple idea: <em>books should feel within reach for everyone</em>.
                        From school students to working professionals and lifelong readers, 
                        our shelves are arranged to make browsing easy and enjoyable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We focus on hand-picked titles across fiction, mystery, sci-fi, romance,
                        horror and non-fiction so that every visit gives you something new to discover.

                    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to build a space where people can slow down, read peacefully
                        and talk about stories. We support local authors where possible and
                        regularly add fresh titles based on what our readers ask for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are looking for a particular book, you can always ask us in person
                        when you visit the store – we are happy to help.
