<h2 class="description-heading">Description</h2>
<p class="book-description">Wedding planner Tanvi Bedi is all fired up about her new project, the $100 million wedding of a media heiress. The only hitch is her client’s wishlist chef, Nik Shankar, who avoids weddings at all costs. But there must be something—or someone—he can’t resist.
Nik Shankar’s inheritance is in jeopardy due to his estranged grandfather’s absurd caveat: marry or lose his ancestral home. When Tanvi storms into his office, a surprising solution emerges—Nik will do the wedding if Tanvi poses as his fiancée.
What starts a recipe for disaster turns into a delectable feast of fiery passion. As pretense blurs into reality, Tanvi and Nik must confront their inner demons before their charade goes up in smoke.
